# Procgen

This is a repo for my submissions to the NeurIPS 2020 Procgen competition. My solution incorporated a lot of experimentation. Effective strategies included sparse and noisy pseudo-ensembling, reward shaping, action masking, entropy based exploration strategies, curiosity bonuses, framestacking, continuous life accumulation, episode checkpointing, and network hyperparameter tuning.
